CIFAR-10 is a dataset of 60,000 32x32 colour images with 10 classes. Each class has 6,000 labeled images.
The training set contains 50,000 images and the testing set contains 10,000.

## Model Architecture
2 convolutional Layers with ReLU activation functions, and 2x2 Max Pooling Layers after each
4 Fully Connected Linear Layers with ReLU activation functions
